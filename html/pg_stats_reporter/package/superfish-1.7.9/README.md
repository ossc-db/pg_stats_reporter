# jQuery Superfish Dropdown Menu Plugin

Our favourite aquatic superhero returns from his sojourn across the galaxy infused with astonishing, hitherto unseen new powers. In his modern incarnation (wearing a rather spiffy cape) Superfish is dedicated to keeping dropdown/flyout menus accessible across browsers great and small, in addition to adding support for newer touch devices (running Android, iOS, Windows, etc). All this **and** a pretty face.

## Documentation and Demos

Please use the [existing Superfish documentation](https://superfish.joelbirch.co/) where you will find full explanations of the customisable features and plenty of examples to get you started.

## Need help?

Superfish menus have been in use since the dawn of time (well, around 8 years or so) and many are the places where you can find help with your Superfish implementations. [Check out the support options](https://superfish.joelbirch.co/download/#support).
